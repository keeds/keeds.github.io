As an software developer and a bit of a tech geek I have become fascinated by the numbers involved in cycling and training with power. FTP, MPA, XSS, HIE, LTP, TSS, TSB, ATL, CTL, IF. All the pretty charts, the upward curves (yeah right), the sea of data, the sense of achievement of producing it all that stuff. It's all good right?

Well... I've come to the conclusion that the answer is yes and no, but mainly no (for me). Which I know is rather radical and will cause some heated conversation in the LBC. Oops.

Anyway, "Why so?" I hear you ask.

I think there is pretty concrete agreement on there being 3 main components to improving performance: Training, Nutrition and Recovery, but I think that is as far as you can go. Within any of those 3 areas individually or any combination of them you will find completely different approaches/evidence/ideas depending upon which expert you read/listen too and which programme you follow.

There are now a multitude of ways of, and tools for, micro managing your training based on power or heart rate data. These give you the sea of data and the glorious charts to show you that stuff is happening.

There are a multitude of diets, plans, supplements, routines you can try. All disagreeing with each other and maybe not fitting in with your training programee.

And for recovery, you can sleep more and do less when you aren't training (Yeah right!)

I'm not a professional athlete. I don't have time to plan all this correctly, I don't have time to follow it exactly and I certainly don't have time to adapt it when I inevitably fall off the schedule/plan. So for me, it's seems like a whole load of stress, energy (and money) worrying about getting things perfect and then not being able to follow it, but being comforted that you are generating all this data and pretty charts.

# Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)

# Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Timed (SMART)
* Use CX specific training (That's where I want to improve)
* At least maintain current power (?.?W/Kg)
* Reduce %body fat from ?% to ?%
* By start of Sept '18 (CX season)

# The Plan
* Limited time training
  * HIIT stuff
  * KISS races (Zwift)
  * Running for endurance
* Strength training
  * 7 minutes
  * Bulgarian Split Squats 
* Eat better
  * More protein
  * Less bad carbs
* Sleep more
