[David Nolen](http://swannodette.github.io/) has recently released clojurescript 0.0-2496 with cljs.test included. Previously, I've never really got around to getting effective testing setup for clojurescript projects up and running so I thought I would take this as an opportunity to do so.

You can find a base setup here: [cljsinit](https://gitlab.com/keeds/cljsinit). You can clone this and run using: lein cljsbuild auto test


In summary:

* You need leiningen, phantomjs (in your path)
* Setup a cljsbuild target for testing
* Use cljsbuild :notify-command to run phantomjs with a runner script (see phantom folder)
* Run using: lein cljsbuild auto test  (test is just the name of the build target)

I plan to make a lein template for this at some point.
