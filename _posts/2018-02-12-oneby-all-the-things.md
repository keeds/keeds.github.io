So the conversion of the Ridley to Roadie has taken place (after a minor hiccup with rounding out a chainring bolt)...

* 50T front chainring: Tick
* 11-36T cassette: Tick
* 28mm road rubber: Tick

# How does she ride?
After a single windy/hilly ride she seems to be sweet as a nut. Super silent transmission, no front derailleur rub obviously. Plenty of range in the gears, enough up top and down the bottom. No really nasty big steps between gears. Super happy. Will have to see we go in a group ride and on Zwift racing (might miss the extra 2T upfront there).
