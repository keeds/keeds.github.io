So, we are a few days passed the end of the 17/18 cyclo cross season (for the [east league](http://www.easterncross.org.uk/index.htm)) and starting to think about "what now?". Rob Bates from [The Pedal House](http://www.thepedalhouse.co.uk) keeps asking a really good question: "What have your learnt?". So lets start there.

* It's flippin good fun
* I definately don't go deep enough
* Technique needs improving
* Repeated accelerations are hard
* Beyond the basics, kit really doesn't matter

# It's flippin good fun
Remember when you were a kid and how much fun it was to be outside in all weathers, just running around like an idiot, not worrying about getting filthy dirty, having a ball... That's cyclocross, just on a bike. It's taken a long time to get around to trying it but I'm here now. The people are great. Shouting encouragement, sharing advice, kit, food and laughs. It's a good craic.

# I definately don't go deep enough
I think I'm pushing, but I'm not really. I think I'm at my limit but I'm not really. Watching other's who are actually giving it the beans, on the rivet, dropping the hammer, is pretty damn inspiring to watch. Especially when those doing it are youths/juniors/boys/girls giving it everything. Pretty damn inspiring is not really strong enough. Very humbling and Very inspiring. As a middle aged, more than slightly tubby grumpy old man I've been taught a very valuable lesson by all those young whipper snappers in the East League. Go hard or go home!

# Technique needs improving
So who knew? Just staying upright, getting off and on the bike, riding in mud/sand/snow, running/walking with a bike, jumping over stuff with bike. It's hard work and it's even harder to do quickly and smoothly. I've fallen off plenty, ridden off into the undergrowth in the opposite direction I was actually trying to go, jumped onto the nose of the saddle making me ride the remaining laps with it pointing straight down. Stumbled over hurdles, failed to remount, gouged my calves with pedals, and we won't mention the crown jewels.

# Repeated accelerations are hard
Watching other riders laying on the power at every opportunity and not being able to do the same hurts. Whether it hurts as much as actually doing it, or gaining the fitness required to be able do so to without going "pop", probably not?

# Beyond the basics, kit really doesn't matter
So as a MAMIL this one hurts... Beyond a CX bike, with CX tyres and definately shoes that can take spikes I would say you are done. Nothing you add or lose is going to make as much difference to performance as some of those things listed above.

# So the plan for this coming September
Have fun, go hard, get some technique and get some fitness!

# Me
If you are at all interested, I placed a lowly 43rd in the Vets 40's in my first season [results](http://www.easterncross.org.uk/placings17-18-e.htm). I rode all the races in the season, DNF'ing only once in the last due to a front puncture.
